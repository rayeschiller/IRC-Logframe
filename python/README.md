   ```mkdir IRC-logframe```
   ```cd IRC-logframe```
4. Clone bitbucket repository in the command line using 
   ```git clone REPO_URL```

10. Go to _http://127.0.0.1:8000/_ to see the django app

### Frontend Setup

# Database Configuration
By default, this application will use sqlite3 as a database backend. If a different backend is needed, please add the following to your _.env_ file. This example assumes you are using postgresql as a database backend:
```vim
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
DB_NAME=nameofdb
DB_PASSWORD=passwordfordb
DB_USER=usernamefordb
DB_HOST=hostiporname
DB_PORT=portnumber
```

# Production
For production, please change or add the following to your _.env_ file:
```vim
ALLOWED_HOSTS=name.com,smeti.com,etc.com " A list of comma separated hostname (MUST BE CHANGED IN PROD. The use of * is discouraged.
SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey " Do not use the one from .env.example as it may not be secure
```

# FAQ

__Why virtual environment?__
if you have more than one project or use Python on your machine for things other than Django, you may run into dependency issues between your applications and the installed packages. For this reason, we'll be using virtualenv to manage our Django installation. This is common, and recommended, practice among Python and Django users.

__How to activate virtual environment?__
Open a terminal window and type: workon IRC-logframe Your current terminal will use the python version used by the projectâ€™s virtualenv

__How to exit virtual environment?__
On the terminal type: deactivate or just close the terminal
